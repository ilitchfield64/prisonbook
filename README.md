The Prisonbook as we have affectionalty named it is a laptop is a SecureBook 5 originally sold by "Justice Tech Solutions" 

These devices are beginning to show their age and a bunch of us have bought them second hand. With efforts from @Techknight, @Zephray, @sark and many others we have managed to locate some workarounds to get a non-factory install working on the laptop
